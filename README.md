# SaveSoul - Web Application for Donations to NGOs
SaveSoul is a web application that enables individuals and organizations to donate various resources, including food, clothing, medicine, and financial contributions, to non-governmental organizations (NGOs).

All funds donated through SaveSoul are utilized to support NGOs' vital initiatives and bring positive change to the lives of those in need.

SaveSoul integrates a comprehensive messaging system, enabling effective communication between donors and NGOs. This system facilitates discussions on specific items needed, drop-off or pickup locations, and other relevant information. It also enables donors to stay informed about the impact of their contributions and gain insights into the noble work carried out by the supported NGOs.
